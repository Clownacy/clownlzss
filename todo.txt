Add Comper-X
Add support for Rocket's Saxman-style 0x20 thingy
Check if Rocket and Rage's length/distance values are correct
Add decompressors
Dynamically-allocate state and/or leave it to the user
Add actual sliding window buffer?
- Supports Saxman's "zero-fill mode" the 'proper' way
- Supports Rockets's "0x20-fill mode" the 'proper' way
- May make string comparison faster as the length of the comparison does not have to be capped near the end of the file buffer
- Makes it unnecessary to have the whole file loaded into memory
